# Teaching Intermediate Python for Girls Who Code

**POC:** Nina Rauscher (nr2861@columbia.edu)

*Columbia Girls Who Code* is a club aiming at offering an introduction to programming to young girls from 9 to 18 years-old over 6 weeks.

Their traditional offering includes two programs:
1. *Intro to CS in Python*
2. *Intro to Web Development* (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

Due to a higher than usual number of applications for their programs, the club decided to launch a new *Intermediate Python* course.

Excited by the opportunity of creating a new program from scratch and making CS more accessible to young girls, I joined *Girls Who Code* in October 2023 as one of the 2 teachers in charge of the *Intermediate Python* course.

All the materials we created for this class (slides, exercises, notebooks) are available in this repo, following this curriculum:
- Lecture 1: Python Basics (Oct 14, 2023)
- Lecture 2: Advanced Data Types (Oct 21, 2023)
- Lecture 3: Data Analysis & Visualization (Oct 28, 2023)
- Lecture 4: Accessing Data & Web Scraping (Nov 12, 2023)
- Lecture 5: APIs (Nov 18, 2023)

 Our mission is to increase gender diversity in Tech and STEM fields by teaching high schoolers in the NYC area how to code and creating a community of passionate students interested in STEM/Tech fields on Columbia's campus.

 If you are interested in launching a similar program in your university or neighborhood, feel free to inspire from the materials we've developed and give us feedback along the way so that we can also improve ours :)
